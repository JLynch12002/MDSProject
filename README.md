***Overview***
A novel anomaly detection framework for evaluating digital twin (DT) fidelity at runtime. The framework distinguishes between expected model inaccuracies in low-fidelity DTs and genuine anomalous behaviour using a hierarchical detection system combining statistical thresholds and deep learning.
